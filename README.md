# Simple MVC
In this project, i have used MVC pattern, i.e . Model - View - Controller

There is [DbController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fsawant%2Fmihir%2Fsimplemvc%2Fcontroller%2FDbController.java) which is 
controller class for DB, configuration of connection and manging query operations.

[ProductController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fsawant%2Fmihir%2Fsimplemvc%2Fcontroller%2FProductController.java), is web or 
main controller which handles operations for products and calls view pages.

in webapp directory there are two files [product_page.jsp](src%2Fmain%2Fwebapp%2Fproduct_page.jsp), [show_details.jsp](src%2Fmain%2Fwebapp%2Fshow_details.jsp)
which are views.
